          As an entry-level software engineer, I am dedicated to building a
          strong foundation in computer science. I have earned multiple
          certificates from Udemy and FreeCodeCamp, sharpening my skills and
          expertise through rigorous study and practice. Every day, I challenge
          myself with LeetCode problems to stay sharp and stay ahead of the
          curve. <br /> While I may be new to the field, I have already taken on
          a number of exciting projects, working with several clients to deliver
          innovative and effective software solutions. With my background as a
          Graphic Designer, I bring a unique perspective and skill set to the
          world of software engineering. I am excited to take the next steps in
          my career and join a company where I can continue to grow and develop
          as a software engineer. With my passion, dedication, and commitment to
          excellence, I am confident that I will make a valuable contribution to
          any team.
